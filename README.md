### Who am I ?

Hey! I'm Ricardo Marques, I'm from sunny Lisbon, Portugal with a Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering. I have a passion for robotics and creative problem solving. In my previous position I was working as the Robotics Team Lead at [Skypull SA](https://www.skypull.technology/) creating the fully autonomous drones that will power the tomorrow. As an open source advocate I've made many contributions to public repos/projects such as PX4, MAVLink, MAVROS, etc. Skills and experiences involve UAVs in general, C++ and ROS.
